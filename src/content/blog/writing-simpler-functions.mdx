Simple code is better than complex code.[^simple-made-easy-plug] And yet
I often come across functions that take me 20 minutes to understand that do
nothing more than call two or three other helpers and combine their results.

Why? Many functions end up spending more time dealing with side concerns than
with achieving their actual goal.

## Loops hiding in functions

One example is some functions that take arrays as parameters and contain loops.

I'm always suspicious of functions that take arrays as parameters. In many
cases, these loops are better off lifted outside of the function.

```ts
// ❌ often worse
const orders = [
  { name: "Apples", price: 10 },
  { name: "Oranges", price: 20 },
  { name: "Bananas", price: 30 },
];
function computeTaxes(orders) {
  const taxes = [];
  for (const order of orders) {
    taxes.push(order.price * 0.07);
  }
  return taxes;
}
const taxes = computeTaxes(orders);
```

Here's how this can be improved:

```ts
// ✅ usually better 
const orders = [
  { name: "Apples", price: 10 },
  { name: "Oranges", price: 20 },
  { name: "Bananas", price: 30 },
];
function computeTax(order) {
  return order.price * 0.07;
}

// You can also use a loop if you prefer
const taxes = orders.map(computeTax);
```

The second option is preferable because it creates a more general function that
can be called on a single `Order` if necessary.

If I have an `Order`, I shouldn't have to put it in an array to call `computeTax()`.

This idea doesn't apply just to arrays, although array examples are the most
common version in my experience. For languages with nullable types,
promises/futures, and [other sorts of wrapped types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor_(functional_programming)), it is nearly
always better to unwrap the type before operating on it.

## Promises hiding in functions

Promises as function arguments are also suspicious.

```ts
// ❌ often worse
async function getFullEventName(eventPromise: Promise<Event>) {
  const event = await eventPromise;
  return event.title + ' via ' + event.source;
}
const eventPromise = getEventAsync();
await getFullEventName(eventPromise);
```
<br />
```ts
// ✅ usually better 
function getFullEventName(event: Event) {
  return event.title + ' via ' + event.source;
}
const event = await getEventAsync();
const eventName = getFullEventName(event);
```

The second option is preferable because it creates a more general function that
can be called on a non-promise if necessary.

If I have an `Event`, I shouldn't have to put it in a promise to call
`getFullEventName()`.

## Optionality hiding in functions

Similarly, it's rarely right to pass something that could be null into
a function.

```ts
// ❌ often worse
function formatLogs(logs: string | null) {
  if (logs === null) throw Error("logs is null!");
  return [
    "======= LOGS =======",
    logs,
    "===== END LOGS ====="
  ].join("\n");
}
const logs: string | null = readFile("logs.txt");
const formattedLogs = formatLogs(logs);
```
<br />
```ts
// ✅ usually better 
function formatLogs(logs: string) {
  return [
    "======= LOGS =======",
    logs,
    "===== END LOGS ====="
  ].join("\n");
}
const logs: string | null = readFile("logs.txt");
if (logs === null) throw Error("file read failed!");
const formattedLogs = formatLogs(logs);
```

> Note the more descriptive error message that is made possible by the structure
> of the second example.

Hopefully the pattern is becoming clear.[^functors] Moving unrelated details out of
the helper simplifies the functions. This makes the helper functions more
versatile and can have further refactoring benefits down the line.

For example, you might be able to avoid redundant null checks in multiple
helper functions by moving a null check closer to the variable's origin.[^null-checks]

I also find that bugs are significantly easier to find in functions that are
properly simplified.

```ts
function computeTaxes(orders) {
  const taxes = [];
  for (const order of orders) {
    taxes.push(order.price * 00.7);
  }
  return taxes;
}
```
<br />
```ts
function computeTax(order) {
  return order.price * 00.7;
}
```

Readability differences in key logic matter.

## Exceptions

Sometimes, for performance, it's better to compute in a batch style. In those
cases, I favor the faster option. One common case is batch database inserts.

The otherwise odd choice to take an array as a parameter suggests to the caller
of the function to pass the entire data at once.

```ts
// ❌ often worse
function ingestUpload({ name, data }) {
  db.sql("INSERT INTO uploads VALUES (?, ?)", name, data);
}
// it's easy to forget to wrap this in a transaction
for (const upload of uploads) {
  ingestUpload(upload);
}
```
With `ingestUploads()`, you can't forget to wrap your inserts in a transaction.
```ts
// ✅ usually better 
function ingestUploads(uploads) {
  db.sql("BEGIN TRANSACTION");
  for (const { name, data } of uploads) {
    db.sql("INSERT INTO uploads VALUES (?, ?)", name, data);
  }
  db.sql("END TRANSACTION");
}
ingestUploads(uploads);
```

And of course I'm sure there are other exceptions. But I see far more examples
of people mistakenly cluttering otherwise simple functions _without_ good
reason than of people writing nicer batch processing functions. Many folks have
the wrong default.

## Conclusion

If you recognize the above antipatterns in your own code, refactor! This is one
of those refactorings that should be a reflex, because it's a straightforward
transformation that can have a big impact on the quality of the code.

[^null-checks]:
    Granted, it's a lot easier to confidently remove null checks in languages
    where the type system tracks nullability for you (TypeScript, Rust, Kotlin,
    and others). But even in a language like C or Java, you can still reap
    benefits like better branch prediction (and performance) from pushing those
    null checks all the way to a variable's origin.
[^functors]:
    If the commonality between arrays, promises, and nullable values is new to
    you, I encourage you to look into the concepts of functors and monads in
    functional programming. The rabbit hole goes deeper than you may think...
