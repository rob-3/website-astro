While I enjoy a good game of pure chance now and again, I prefer games where
strategy and tactics rule the day. Even so, I believe there's a time and place
for luck in board games. Not every game should be chess (or
[_Diplomacy_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/483/diplomacy)).[^diplomacy]
Done properly, luck and hidden information enhance a game of
strategy—bringing variety to games, allowing players who are losing to
catch up, and forcing even the best players to learn how to play from
behind.

## Problems with Chess

Games of pure strategy have a problem. We need look no further than chess to
see what happens to a game where there is no element of chance and no hidden
information. Chess is a brilliant test of tactical and strategic thinking, but
many people find it dull because there are so many draws and an entrenched
metagame.

Both of these unfortunate characteristics follow from its design. A fixed
starting setup with no elements of chance or secret information means the
opening is largely solved. In lower level play, there's more possibilities for
theoretically suboptimal openings, but at the highest level, play collapses
into the same openings again and again.

	is perhaps the most common draw in professional chess, requiring just 14
	moves.

Higher level chess play also results in many, many draws. This is inevitable
for any fair game without luck - a game of pure strategy can only be fair if no
player can force a win from the beginning position. This demands a draw if
neither player makes a mistake.

## Luck in Small Doses

It is easy for a game to move too far in the other direction. An extreme
example is the childhood classic: Candyland.[^candyland]

Candyland involves no player choice at all. The outcome is entirely a function
of random chance. While there's some suspense and drama as players get stuck or
pass each other on the board, there is no way to impact your fate. Candyland is
generally unfun for me.

There's a nice middle ground between Candyland and chess. Strategy games, but
with a dash of luck. Rather than robbing players of agency, these games use
luck and hidden information to broaden possible gameplay. A standard example is
one of my favorite board games: [Twilight
Struggle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12333/twilight-struggle).
Twilight Struggle masterfully incorporates chance.

Twilight Struggle is a Cold War themed game centered around a deck of unique
cards. Instead of resigning players to a game determined by how the cards fall,
or eschewing chance altogether like chess, Twilight Struggle uses luck to
enhance the strategy of the game. Every card will be drawn by one of the two
players eventually, but where and when key cards land is critical. It's
essential to continually consider multiple contingencies to master the game.
Good strategy involves playing around cards your opponent may not even have!
Twilight Struggle captures the paranoia of the Cold War wonderfully in this
way.

	The timing and control of key events like De-Stalinization and
	Indo-Pakistani War can dramatically change the outcome of a game of Twilight Struggle.

Twilight Struggle also encourages risk taking with all-or-nothing "war" cards
that hinge on the outcome of a single dice roll. While these cards clearly
swing the game away from strategy and towards luck, they enrich game variety.
When there's an upset in an outcome, it can provide a path back to victory for
a trailing player, or send the game in an entirely unexpected direction.
Because every card is different and dice rolls are random, it's all but certain
that after the first turn your game is entirely unique. It has never (and will
never) play out exactly the same way. That is pretty cool.[^chess-duplicates]

Even better is the kind of thinking this variety demands from players. Rather
than pressing their advantage, the leader in a game of Twilight Struggle needs
to play cautiously and insure themselves against future bad luck to remain
ahead. One can't simply coast, avoid mistakes, and win off the back of a small
advantage as in chess.[^theory]

Similarly, a player who is behind must learn to play to their outs—what is the
most likely sequence of events that can get them back in the game?

## Conclusion

Why do I prefer a game like Twilight Struggle to a game like chess? I think
it's because real life involves risk and unknowns. Chess asks you to pretend
a battle is a precise and mechanical affair.[^unrealistic] Twilight Struggle
accepts that the world is messy. Good plans can fail, yet the game goes on.
It's remarkable to lose, but be happy you played better than your opponent.

Luck in a game is like salt on a dish. Too much, and you've ruined it; too
little, and it is bland.

Designers—salt your games!

[^diplomacy]:
	At the time of writing, my brother is the reigning midwest champion for
	Diplomacy, and generally beats me at the game. He's also better than me at
	chess. These things may color my judgement.
[^candyland]:
	Candyland is great for kids. It teaches color recognition skills, and makes
	it possible for the average 5 year old to beat their parents. It's not the
	kind of game I enjoy playing, though (excepting a cute kid). Every game has
	its use.
[^chess-duplicates]:
	Chess has a wonderful possibility space, especially at lower levels. But at
	the highest level, it is not uncommon to see occasional duplicates of
	games. Granted, some of this is due to the sheer mass of recorded games of
	chess.
[^theory]:
	And memorizing game lines is of pretty limited use! Although there are
	patterns of play and recurring strategic and tactical themes, one must
	learn the motifs (and when to break them) rather than prepare for any
	specific scenario.

	To be fair, chess has a good deal of this as well, which I count as a big
	positive for the game, and part of why it has flourished.
[^unrealistic]:
	To be fair, games in general will never be an accurate simulation of that
	which they depict. I don't think games should try to be a facsimile of
	their subject matter. Some hardcore wargames go in this direction and
	aren't fun for most people.

	But I do think there's an art in capturing elements of the game subject
	within a game's design. Good physical pieces, rule design, and gameplay
	design add to the play experience. My favorite games all capture their
	subject matter in a way that just fits.
