_Dune: Imperium_ captures _Dune_'s subtle dance of political intrigue and outright
conflict in a game with a delightful mix of deck-building, combat, and worker
placement.

## Pieces and Packaging

_Dune: Imperium_ has good quality pieces, with nothing to complain about. The
wooden cubes, agent tokens, and resources are nice. The cards are standard, but
have held up through more than a dozen games so far. I appreciate the inclusion
of a nice cardboard insert in the box that prevents the game board from sliding
around inside.

## Instructions

_Dune: Imperium_'s instructions are modern and thorough. There's a helpful
"Clarifications" section near the end of the rules that nicely documents edge
cases for confusing cards. Rules are explained with corresponding illustrated
examples.

There's a separate rules sheet for 2 player or solo games. I have only played
the 2 player game once, and found it less ideal than 3 or 4 player games. The
game is really designed for 3 or 4 players. However, it's a nice inclusion
regardless.

One improvement I might suggest is a larger end-of-game section. Due to the
nature of the game, players often don't understand endgame intrigue cards and
want to secretly look up what they do. The rules for these cards are only
briefly described in one sentence in the intrigue cards section and a small
text box at the end of the rules. There is a nice dictionary section on the
back of the rules that explains all of the symbols; something about endgame
cards there would be a welcome addition.

## Gameplay

I'm usually skeptical of games branded with major IPs; many rely on the
popularity of the IP to carry sales, often to the detriment of good gameplay.

However, I'm happy to report that this is not the case for _Dune: Imperium_.
The game is enjoyable and comprehensible even for someone with no _Dune_
knowledge, but the connections between the _Dune_ universe and the game are
thoughtfully executed and enhance the experience for _Dune_ fans. This is what
games with popular IP should be.[^villainous]

_Dune: Imperium_'s gameplay centers around 3 core mechanics:

1. Worker Placement
2. Deck-Building
3. Conflict

Each turn, players play 2-3 cards and place 2-3 agents on board spaces to
collect resources and cards that will help them gain victory points and rally
troops to participate in a conflict.

The interesting twist in the game is that the cards that you play determine the
board spaces your agents can go to. While everyone begins with an identical
starting deck, as you acquire new cards, your strategy becomes dictated by what
sections of the board you're able to frequently visit. 

In the later stages of the game, key squares might become entirely inaccessible
or only accessible every few turns to players who poorly plan their deck
construction. I've won multiple games against otherwise shoe-in winners who
were locked out of the Heighliner space on the final turn.

        <p class="m-0 mt-1 md:text-base">Looks like we're going to yellow triangle this turn...</p>
    </figcaption>

Conflict is a key part of the strategy in the game. _Dune Imperium_ allows
players to build up their forces over multiple turns, so there are often
complex decisions about how many troops to allocate to this turn and how many
to save for next turn. Regular cards and Intrigue cards can both also impact
the outcome of combat, so turn order and hidden information ensure the outcome
is never certain until the end of the turn.

The interplay between the cards, worker placement, and allocating troops
presents a unique puzzle for players. Should you try to draw more cards to
purchase a better card at turn end? Should you accept a worse square to commit
more troops to the conflict? What should you purchase - a card that helps in
combat, or helps you place your agents more effectively? (Sometimes the correct
choice is to purchase nothing at all!)

Because there are many unique cards in the Imperium deck, different strategies
become possible depending on what cards are available throughout the game. The
conflict rewards are also not fixed game-to-game, so players can't rely on
winning a particular conflict reward. _Dune: Imperium_ has great replayability
for these reasons.

Every turn offers myriad options, and how your opponents play the conflict can
play a big role in your own turn. You may not have planned to fight this turn,
but if nobody else is sending troops in, it might be worthwhile to adjust your
plans. I love Eurogames, but _Dune: Imperium_ is an American-style game done
right. The competition between players for conflict rewards, cards, and faction
alliances works well, and is the crux of the game.

_Dune: Imperium_ is largely a game of strategy. While players can get lucky
with conflicts or card availability, early successes do not lead to an
insurmountable advantage. The randomness deepens the strategy, as players must
stay flexible and take risks in combat and agent placement to stay competitive
with others.

In terms of length, _Dune: Imperium_ is fixed-length game. The game cannot go
more than 10 turns, and usually ends on turn 7 or 8. Once you learn the rules,
it plays in the same 2.5-3 hours every time. I like the length. It is long
enough that strategic decisions make a difference, but short enough that the
focus remains squarely on tactical play.

## Design

_Dune: Imperium_ is brought to us by designer Paul Dennen,[^clank] and is
a case study in great game design.

Almost no cards or game spaces feel useless, and yet Dennen does a good job
ensuring cards and spaces feel unique. Powerful effects are appropriately
costed and limited. The most powerful cards and spaces in the game (Kwisatz
Haderach, Heighliner) are good, but not unbeatable.

The playable character options are different enough to add some asymmetry to
the game, while not dictating the strategy you have to play. The design of Paul
Atreides is particularly brilliant: his ability to look into your future cards
unless your deck is empty is perfectly representative of his inconsistent
visions in the books.

The design of the different factions, especially the Bene Gesserit, is also
excellent. The ability to trash cards through selective breeding is on-theme
and a great lore-mechanic match. It's not just the Bene Gesserit either; _Dune:
Imperium_ matches in-game effects of cards to the _Dune_ lore in a way that
fans will appreciate.

The game's symbolic notation is intuitive and aids understanding of novel
cards. Words are used sparingly to describe unique effects not easily encoded
through the symbols. Designers should look to _Dune: Imperium_ as an example of
how to balance text against symbols.[^bang]

One criticism I have with the design is that it often feels like the Imperium
row of cards available for purchase is stale. Sometimes, a card is replaced by
a duplicate of a card already available. If players buy Arrakis Liaisons or
The Spice Must Flow cards, the Imperium row remains the same. It's not a huge
problem, but I've seen other games add some amount of automated churn so a pile
of undesirable cards can slowly be replaced.

## Conclusion

_Dune: Imperium_ is one of my favorite new[^newish] games. The gameplay is
excellent, and the _Dune_ theme is well-executed. Games are kept fresh with
different available cards and wildly different strategies can all be
successful. I recommend _Dune: Imperium_ even to non-_Dune_ fans.

[^villainous]:
	I'm hopeful that _Dune: Imperium_ continues a trend for major brands paying
	for high-quality design in games with popular IP.
		[Villainous](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/256382/disney-villainous-the-worst-takes-it-all)
		is another recent game that is thoughtfully designed despite being from
	a popular IP.
[^newish]:
	If one can consider a 4-year-old game "new".
[^bang]:
	Though I enjoy a good game of
	[BANG!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3955/bang), it's an example of
	a game where symbolic notation tries to do too much. Sometimes words are
	just the more straightforward way to describe an effect.
[^clank]:
	I recently played Dennen's other major title,
	[Clank!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/201808/clank-a-deck-building-adventure),
	for the first time. It's worth a play if you haven't tried it. It shares
	the partial deck-building mechanic but has a dungeon crawling theme.
